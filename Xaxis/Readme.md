# X axis

This axis consist of a 20x20 V-shaped aluminum frame mounted on the two Z-axis carriers.

The motor is mounted on the 20x20 piece with 2 3D-printed angles that hold the same motor mount used in in all axis. These angles turned out to be rather fragile, I broke them twice when I screwed them too hard against the 20x20 piece.
The carrier for the "extruder" is modified with respect to the other axis to fit the 20mm aluminum piece (the rest are 40mm) and has three 5mm screw holes with holes for the nuts on the back to mount the pipette holder.
