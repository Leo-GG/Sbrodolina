# Y axis

This is the first axis I designed after I managed to make the syringe pump. It consist of a motor mounted on a 20x40 V-shaped aluminum piece and a "carrier" with a leadscrew nut and 4 bearings to move along the frame.

The part holding the leadscrew nut are fixed with 3mm screws that are inserted in the corresponding 3mm nuts inserted in the main pieces of the carrier. I was expecting this piece to break apart as soon as the motor started to rotate, but instead they seem to be holding quite well :)
