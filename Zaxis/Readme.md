# Z axis

This axis consists of two motors attached to the frame with the same motor mount used in the Y axis. 
Each motor drives a 8mm leadscrew that moves the carriers. The carriers on the motor side are the same as in the Y axis. 
On the front side (opposite to the motors) the carriers are just a flat piece with four holes for 5mm screw nuts (to hold the two sides together) and four holes for 5mm screws to hold the X axis mount.

The X axis mount is a single piece on each side. I first tried using 4 separated angle pieces, but it was way too wobbly. The current design is not too terrible, so it might stay as it is.
